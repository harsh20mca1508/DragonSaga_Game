# DragonSaga_Game
Dragon Saga is a game which is inspired from the crome dino game that we play while we are not connected to internet. In this game we tried to give it better user interface and make it colorfull which makes it different and interesting from other games. 
And the special thing is that we have created this game by basic programming languages that are HTML, CSS and JAVA SCRIPT. Also the coding is kept at basic level so it is easy to uderstand for beginners.
check out this game, play and do comments how do you feel while playing this game and let us know any suggestions from your side.
THANK YOU
